# Sketches

A repository for WIP Generative Art sketches in Processing.

Some CC code adapted from Matt Pearson's _Generative Art: a practical guide using Processing_, which I'm currently working through.

This is a running log of my exploration of generative art.

Everything here is a WIP, so expect Lax Documentation Standards.

I'll put a real license here eventually, but feel free to share/remix/adapt, with a link back to [my website](http://joeflynn.net) if you could.
